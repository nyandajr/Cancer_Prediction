Breast Cancer Diagnosis Tool
This project is a Breast Cancer Diagnosis Tool developed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. The tool predicts the malignancy of a breast tumor based on various input features using a machine learning model trained on breast cancer dataset.

About
The Breast Cancer Diagnosis Tool is designed to assist in predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and trained datasets to provide a possible diagnosis based on input features.

Disclaimer
The prediction provided by this tool is based solely on the input data and the model it was trained on. It should not be considered as a definitive diagnosis. Consultation with a healthcare professional is advised for an accurate diagnosis.

Usage
To use the tool, follow these steps:

Input Features: Enter the required input features related to the breast tumor, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

Prediction: Click on the "Predict" button to generate a prediction based on the input features provided.

Interpretation: The tool will display the prediction, indicating whether the tumor is predicted to be malignant or benign.
